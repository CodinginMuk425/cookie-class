<h3> History of cookies</h3> 
    <p>Most people don't know the complicated past of the cookie. 
      Cookies appear to have originated in the 7th century in Persia. 
      These delicious treats shortly became popular after sugar became increasigly common in the region. 
      By the 14th century, they were common in all Europe from royal cuisine to street vendors. 
      More information about the history of cookies can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie">here</a>. That is how the cookie crumbles.
